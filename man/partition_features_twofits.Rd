\title{Partition features by comparing per-coordinate collapsed scores from two fits}
\usage{
partition_features_twofits(
  fitA,
  fitB,
  X = NULL,
  delta = 0,
  include_constant = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitA, fitB}{csmooth_em objects (e.g., two different orderings / initializations).}

\item{X}{Optional data matrix. If NULL, uses fitA$data (and assumes same X for both fits).}

\item{delta}{Nonnegative margin. Assign to A only if (CA - CB) > delta; otherwise assign to B.}

\item{include_constant}{Logical; passed to score_features_onefit().}
}
\value{
A list with
  - assign: length-d character vector in {"A","B"}
  - score_diff: length-d vector (CA - CB)
  - CA, CB: length-d vectors of per-feature scores
}
